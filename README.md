### What is Like4Gram?
[**Like4Gram**](https://github.com/RozhakXD/Like4Gram) is a secure tools for Termux users to grow their Instagram follower base. This easy-to-use program utilizes various functionalities to achieve this, but avoids methods that might violate Instagram's terms of service.

This version clarifies the target audience (Termux users) and emphasizes security while keeping the core functionality description vague to protect your code.

### Termux command?
First you must have the [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk) to run this script and for how to use it can be seen on [**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/23WpKsOlnb0). Then you enter this command into termux!
```
$ apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
$ pkg install git python-pip
$ git clone https://github.com/RozhakXD/Like4Gram
$ cd "Like4Gram"
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python Run.py
```

```
$ cd "$HOME/Like4Gram" && git pull
$ python Run.py
```

### Error while carrying out the mission?
- Your account was detected by like4like because it uses automation so the account is temporarily blocked.
- Maybe like4like doesn't have a mission or the mission has finished for today.
- You can ignore if there are problems, the important thing is that you still get missions and coins.

### Can not login?
- Maybe your Instagram account has been checkpointed or your Instagram account has been logged out.
- Maybe you entered the wrong Like4Like cookies or Instagram cookies.
- You must use Kiwi Browser and the Cookie Dough extension to log in successfully.

### Didn't get any coins?
- Maybe the account you are following doesn't exist and there is a problem following their account.
- Maybe it's a problem with the like4like API so you don't get coins.
- You were detected using automation so this caused you not to get coins.

### Warning?!
**Important**: Using Like4Gram involves following other users, which may be considered inauthentic by Instagram and lead to account suspension. We recommend using a new account for this purpose!
